# Development Tasks

## Stage 2 Level 12

Create a new level at the end of the `levels` array in `index.html`. This level should
use the teleport gimmick and include moving hazards so that players cannot just run
straight to the target. The spawn point must not overlap any blocks and the layout
should be solvable.
